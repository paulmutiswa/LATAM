<h1>LATAM</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I recently had the opportunity to work on a project involving the creation of a Power BI dashboard for Latin American students studying at Brigham Young University - Idaho and Ensign College. The objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that would provide valuable insights and analytics specifically tailored to the needs of students in Latin American countries. To achieve this, I leveraged the powerful data visualization capabilities offered by Power BI, integrating various data sources related to student performance, enrollment, demographics, and contact details including WhatsApp numbers, cities, countries, and students who are ready for employment. Through extensive research and consultation with education experts familiar with the region's unique challenges and requirements, I created interactive visualizations that showcased important metrics such as graduation rates, subject preferences, socioeconomic backgrounds, and trends over time. In addition to facilitating data-driven decision-making by educational stakeholders at both individual student and systemic levels, this dashboard also served as a tool for identifying areas of improvement in educational policies and practices within the Latin American context.
